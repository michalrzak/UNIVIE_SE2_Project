# About this project
This is an implementation of the Software Engineering 2 Project from the University of Vienna. It was implemented during the Wintersemester 2021/2022. It was implemented in a team of 4 people

# Goals of the project
The focus of this project is on the architecture of the app.
The app it self is an Android financing app, implemented with Android Java. The focus was not on the UI part of the app, so the looks are rather rudementary.

# Outcomes of project
The project was awarded 13.5/15 points for Milestone 1 (Design + roughly half of the implementation) and 33/34 for Milestone 2 (Entire project).
